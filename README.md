# Arthur_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Data Structures project

Project Summary:
Our project matches organ donors to patients who need transplants. The user can
input a patient to add to the patient list or a donor that will be matched with
a patient. The patients will be organized in a data structure such as a tree,
queue, or linked list. They will each have attributes that include organ needed,
blood type, likelihood of survival, location, and time left to live. The program
will also include a graph that organizes the patients' locations so that the
distance between the donor and the patient can be calculated. This will impact
which patient the donor is paired with.
